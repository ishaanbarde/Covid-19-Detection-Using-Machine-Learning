WHAT IS COVID-19?

A new disease that occurred in 2019 and that was not known previously in human’s coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Coronaviruses (CoVs) are widely variety of viruses that cause respiratory diseases.


WHAT IS DEEP LEARNING?

Deep Learning is a sub- branch of machine learning, concerned with solving high level problems by emulating the working of a human brain. In this project we have used the deep learning concept of Neural network and the it’s sub branches such as ANN’s and CNN’s.


ARTIFICAL NUERAL NETWORK (ANN’s):

Artificial Neural Network (ANN’s), usually simply called neural networks (NN’s), are computing systems inspired by the biological neural network that constitute animal brains. An ANN’s (Artificial Neural Network) is based on a collection of connected units or nodes called artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a brain.


CONVOLUTION NEURAL NETWORK (CNN’s):

In deep learning, a convolutional neural network (CNN, or ConvNet) is a class of artificial neural network (ANN), most commonly applied to analyse visual imagery. They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender system, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. The name "convolutional neural network" indicates that the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution.


SO WHY DID WE USE CNN OVER ANN?

ANN cannot compute millions of parameters. It cannot identify and add sensitive or boundary value data
